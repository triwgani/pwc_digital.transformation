## The Customer Retention

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned and the company doesn't want to lose them. The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination . Currently, they get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary. Therefore, it would be better to know in advance who is at risk . They have done customer analysis with Excel, buta it has always ended in a dead-end. They would like to know more about our customers and the Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.

### Lesson Learned:
1. How to define key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention.
2. How to create a dashboard that visualizes customer demographics and insights.

### Tasks:
1. Define proper KPIs
2. Create a dashboard using the defined KPIs to reflect customer demographics and insights.
